Hi, I'm Tristan 👋

I work on AI kernels for [MTIA](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-training-inference-accelerator-AI-MTIA/) (Meta Training and Inference Accelerator) at Meta. In my free time I like to explore the intersection of AI and audio. I'm from the Netherlands 🇳🇱

I'm (trying to be) active on X — come say hi [@trirpi](https://x.com/trirpi)!
